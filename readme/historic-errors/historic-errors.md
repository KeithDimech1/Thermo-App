# Historic Errors Log

**Purpose:** This document preserves the complete history of all errors that have been fixed and resolved.

**How It Works:**
- When errors are fixed and removed from `build-data/errors/live-errors.md`, they are archived here
- All errors are preserved in sequential order (ERROR-001, ERROR-002, etc.)
- Never delete entries - this is the permanent record
- Git history provides timeline of when errors were fixed
- Individual error files moved to `readme/historic-errors/archived-errors/`

**Quick Stats:**
- Total errors resolved: 
- Last updated: 2025-11-17
